            <h1>Shared Vision</h1>
            <p>By 2019, young people aged 10 to 19 years in Lagos state feel positive and
                Optimistic about their future. They understand that protecting themselves from
                early pregnancy can help them reach their goals, and they have the necessary
                knowledge and skills to do so. They know where to go for information and support
                on sexual health issues, and they access such services as needed. They feel
                comfortable discussing related issues with health providers, their peers, family
                members and leaders in the community. Girls and boys feel self-reliant and
                empowered to protect their bodies, choose healthy relationships and build positive
                future for themselves. <br> <br>
                Young couples have respectful relationships, talk to each other and make decisions
                about sex and contraception together. They feel empowered to delay the choice of
                having children and know the risks of unprotected sex. They know where to access
                contraceptive methods, and they use them correctly and consistently to protect
                themselves. Some young people choose to abstain from sex till they older and ready. <br> <br>
                Young people realise that giving unprotected sex in exchange for things they want
                (like clothes, money, phones etc.) may also result in getting things they do not want
                (like a pregnancy or STI/ HIV). They value their health and their future, and they
                are willing to sacrifice short-term gain (material goods) for long-term goals. They
                believe in their collective efficacy of refusing unprotected sex for a healthy future.
                Non-school goers have options other than early pregnancy and marriage, and
                experience the benefits of delaying pregnancy. <br><br>
                Parents/caretakers and adult community members support young people in
                making healthy choices regarding their sex lives, they listen to their concerns and
                are able to provide helpful advice including directing them to Youth Friendly
                Services. Parents feel empowered and supported, and know that they play a
                valuable role in building their childrenâ€™s future.
