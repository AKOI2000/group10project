            <h1>Teenage pregnancy</h1>
            <p>Teenage pregnancy is a global phenomenon with serious health, social, and economic consequences. It has been central to the global health and development plans of the current SDGs, specifically Goal 3, Target 3.7, which seeks to guarantee global access to reproductive health care facilities. Despite several measures taken to tackle the issue, the phenomenon persists as a global public health concern. Sub-Saharan Africa has among the highest prevalence of teenage pregnancy, with Nigeria standing out with a 104% adolescent fertility rate in comparison to Asiaâ€™s 40.1%. <br><br> The high teenage pregnancy rate in Nigeria and other African countries is a threat to the actualization of Sustainable Development Goal 5. According to WHO, teenage or adolescent pregnancy is defined as those in young women between ages 10 and 19. About 400,000 unplanned births occur annually in Nigeria, with half of these births to teenage girls between the ages of 15 and 19 years. This poses a danger to the actualization of Sustainable Development Goal 5.

            <h2> Prevalence of Teenage Pregnancy</h2>
            <p>The United Nations Population Fund reports that 20,000 girls under age 18 give birth daily in developing countries like Nigeria, resulting in 7.3 million births per year. Studies suggest that there are geographical differences in teenage pregnancy in Nigeria, with Northern Nigeria having a higher rate of pregnancy than South Nigeria. A 2018 survey by Africa Check found that female teenagers in the north-west region were almost five times as likely to have had children as their peers in the south-west region. <br><br> The pregnancy rate in Bauchi state is higher than in Lagos state, with 166 out of every 1000 teenage girls giving birth to children. However, the pregnancy rate is higher in rural areas (from 29% in 2003 to 32% in 2018) and dips among girls in urban areas (from 17% in 2003 to 8% in 2018). Research attributes this to increasing levels of education. <br><br> Teenage girls with lower levels of education, lower-income households, and living in rural areas are more likely to experience teenage pregnancy compared with those from high socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds. Additionally, teenage pregnancy is prevalent where access to education, information, and healthcare services is limited due to higher barriers to obtaining and using contraceptives and other preventive measures.
