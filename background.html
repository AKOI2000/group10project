            <h1>Teenage pregnancy</h1>
            <p>Teenage pregnancy is a global phenomenon with clearly known causes and serious health, social, and
                economic
                consequences. It comes at a significant cost to the mother and the new born child, to their family and
                the
                wider society, and increasing inequality. Teenage pregnancy has also been central to the global health
                and
                the development plans of the current sustainable development goals (SDGs), specifically, Goal 3, Target
                3.7,
                which seeks to guarantee global access to reproductive health care facilities. Despite several measures
                taken to tackle the issue of teenage pregnancy by international communities and governments, the
                phenomenon
                persists as a global public health concern. However, the prevalence of teenage pregnancy varies between
                and
                within countries. Sub-Saharan Africa has among the highest prevalence of teenage pregnancy with Nigeria
                standing out with a 104% adolescent fertility rate in comparison to Asia’s 40.1% (UNDSEA). The high
                teenage
                pregnancy rate in Nigeria and other African countries portends danger to the actualization of the
                Sustainable Development Goal 5 (i.e., achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls) by 2030.
                According to The World Health Organisation (WHO), teenage or adolescent pregnancy is defined as those in
                young women between ages 10 and 19. Young women aged 15 to 19 are classified as adolescents, while girls
                between 10 and 14 are called young adolescents. The pregnancy rate counts pregnancies ending in births
                and
                abortions. About 400,000 unplanned births occur annually in Nigeria and half of these births are to
                teenage
                girls between the ages of 15 and 19 years. </p>

            <h2> Prevalence of Teenage Pregnancy</h2>
            <p>In a report by the United Nations Population Fund, 20,000 girls under age 18 give birth daily in
                developing
                countries like Nigeria. This amounts to 7.3 million births per year. About 3 million girls in this age
                bracket resort to unsafe abortions, risking their lives and health. Studies suggest that there are
                geographical differences in teenage pregnancy in Nigeria. While every three teenage girls in Northern
                Nigeria get pregnant, the corresponding figure is one out of ten girls in the South. According to a 2018
                survey by Africa Check, female teenagers in Nigeria’s north-west geopolitical region were almost five
                times
                (29%) as likely to have had children as their peers in Nigeria’s south-west region (6%). For instance,
                166
                out of every 1000 teenage girls in Bauchi state give birth to children as against a lower birth rate of
                22
                out of every thousand in Lagos state (UNICEF, NICS 2021/22 Report). However, the pregnancy rate is
                higher in
                rural areas (from 29% in 2003 to 32% in 2018) and dips among girls in urban areas, (from 17% in 2003 to
                8%
                in 2018). Research attributes this to increasing levels of education. Also, teenage girls with lower
                levels
                of education, lower-income households and living in rural areas are more likely to experience teenage
                pregnancy compared with those from high socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds. Further, teenage
                pregnancy
                is also prevalent where access to education, information, and healthcare services are limited, due to
                higher
                barriers to obtaining and using contraceptives and other preventive measures.</p>
